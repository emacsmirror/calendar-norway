* Norwegian localisation of Emacs Calendar

Based on http://bigwalter.net/daniel/elisp/sv-kalender.el v.1.8 by
Daniel Jensen.

** Usage

Put it somewhere in your =load-path=, then put something like this in
your =~/.emacs=:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Localises date format, weekdays, months, lunar/solar names:
(require 'calendar-norway)
;; Set what holidays you want in your calendar:
(setq calendar-holidays
   (append
    ;; Include days where you don't have to work:
    calendar-norway-raude-dagar
    ;; Include other days that people celebrate:
    calendar-norway-andre-merkedagar
    ;; Include daylight savings time:
    calendar-norway-dst
    ;; And then you can add some non-Norwegian holidays etc. if you like:
    '((holiday-fixed 3 17 "St. Patricksdag")
      (holiday-fixed 10 31 "Hallowe'en")
      (holiday-float 11 4 4 "Thanksgiving")
      (solar-equinoxes-solstices))))
#+END_SRC

If you just want "red calendar days" and the Norwegian date formats,
the following would be enough:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Localise date format, weekdays, months, lunar/solar names:
  (require 'calendar-norway nil 'noerror)
  ;; Show days where you don't have to work:
  (setq calendar-holidays calendar-norway-raude-dagar)
#+END_SRC

Note: requiring this package changes some settings that you may have
already touched in your =~/.emacs= (e.g.
=calendar-date-display-form=), see the top of the file for what it
does.


I highly recommend [[https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-calfw][calfw]] if you want a great-looking Emacs calendar
that works with diary/org-mode/icalendar/howm/etc.

** Bugs

Probably. Patches welcome.
